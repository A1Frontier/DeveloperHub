My base internet speed is 100mb download and 100 mb upload
Today I noticed that my internet speed changed to 2mb/100mb

I rebooted. Still the same
Inverted the ethernet cables and my internet speed changed to 100mb/2mb

I talked with 3 more people on the deeper telegram and they also confirmed this issue, which is:
    ATOM OS version 1.1.13.rel broke the ethernet ports transmition scale.
    Depending on which ethernet port your modem is connected, either you have 100% download ou 100% upload, but not both at the same time.

If i could downgrade to version 1.1.12 i could truly confirm that its a problem with version 1.1.13.rel

Summary	DPR – Wallet - Wallet Management (Transfer DPR issue)
Software Version	1.1.14. rel.
DPN connection	 All in one – Mini – WI-FI router (dd-wrt)
Severity	Major
Priority	High

Description
To propose setting up min and max DPR transfer under DPR – Wallet – Wallet Management.  
1.	Transfer DPR is a great functionality for current 1.1.14.rel.
2.	The AtomOS system currently allow transfer any amount balance to the other Deeper Wallet on the deeper chain.
3.	Recommending to keep minimum 2~5 DPRs to avoid any chain issue when transferring away mined DPR.
4.	Recommending to set up the minimum and maximum transfer amount to maintain the chain’ stability and reliability.
5.	Recommending to follow the current practice of Deeper Network Deeper Chain Bridge.

Steps to reproduce

1.	Withdraw different amount of DPRs from one mini to the other mini in the deeper chain.
2.	Can’t withdraw any amount of DPRs from Wallet tab directly to metabasite.
3.	Only be able to use deeper chain bridge to transfer away DPRs to metamask.


Expected result
1.	To warn the user keeping 2 DPRs at least in the wallet before transferring away.
2.	Need to set up the minimum amount of DPRs requirement and also limiting the Maximum amount of DPRs. First batch of 9 month staked period is coming up.
3.	Need to add address the issue if the staked DPRs slowly release to deeper chain

Actual result
The user can do whatever they want for transferring right now.

Notes
Please take the proactive action to follow the best practice of deeper chain bridge.

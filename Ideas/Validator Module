if the main chain is stable now, please consider the validator module. It is very popular for validation purpose.

Validation module is necessary to check whether the staking, unstaking, PofCr, Credit Score, etc are correct or not for each deeper device.

This module is easy to be added and use and validates data quickly and easily.

It will reduce the amount of supporting tickets from the community members.
